# TaekniogVoruthroun

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a simulation model in Python, based on the research conducted by Zhang and Thomson. The project aims to replicate the findings and provide a tool for further exploration of the concepts discussed in the paper. This paper is about how learning can improve product development processes and how knowledge can help in product design.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to deepen the understanding of the simulation techniques discussed by Zhang and Thomson, and to provide a practical application of these methods in Python. The model in this simulation is agent-based so this will give the students deeper understanding about agent-based simulations. This paper was find by the teacher of this course and encouraged him the students to face this challenge.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TaekniogVoruthroun.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

``` 
cd TaekniogVoruthroun
```
3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
